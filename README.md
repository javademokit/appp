# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts




In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

. Blood Tests
Complete Blood Count (CBC): Measures red and white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets.

Blood Chemistry Tests: Check for glucose, electrolytes, kidney and liver function (e.g., blood glucose, electrolytes, creatinine, ALT, AST).

Lipid Profile: Measures cholesterol and triglycerides.

Blood Culture: Detects infections in the bloodstream.

Coagulation Tests: Assess blood clotting ability (e.g., PT, INR, aPTT).

2. Urine Tests
Urinalysis: Checks for infection, blood, protein, glucose, ketones, and other abnormalities.

Urine Culture: Identifies bacteria causing urinary tract infections.

24-Hour Urine Collection: Measures substances like protein or hormones over a day.

3. Imaging Tests
X-ray: Bone fractures, chest imaging, dental checks.

Ultrasound: Soft tissue imaging, fetal monitoring during pregnancy.

CT Scan (Computed Tomography): Detailed cross-sectional images of body.

MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging): Soft tissue detail like brain, muscles, joints.

Mammography: Breast tissue imaging for cancer screening.

PET Scan: Shows metabolic activity of tissues, often for cancer detection.

4. Pathology and Biopsy Tests
Tissue Biopsy: Sampling tissue for cancer or infection diagnosis.

Cytology: Examining cells (e.g., Pap smear for cervical cancer screening).

Histopathology: Microscopic examination of biopsied tissue.

5. Genetic Tests
Detect genetic disorders, carrier status, or predisposition to diseases.

Examples: BRCA gene test for breast cancer risk, prenatal genetic screening.

6. Microbiological Tests
Culture and Sensitivity: Identify bacteria/fungi and their antibiotic sensitivity.

Rapid Antigen Tests: For infections like COVID-19, strep throat.

PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): Detects DNA/RNA of pathogens, used widely in infectious diseases.

7. Cardiac Tests
Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG): Heart electrical activity.

Echocardiogram: Ultrasound of the heart.

Stress Test: Assesses heart function under exercise.

8. Allergy Tests
Skin Prick Test: Detects allergic reactions to various substances.

Blood Allergy Test (IgE): Measures specific allergic antibodies.

9. Endocrine Tests
Tests for hormone levels such as thyroid function tests (TSH, T3, T4), cortisol, insulin, etc.

10. Other Specialized Tests
Bone Density Test (DEXA Scan): Measures bone strength for osteoporosis.

Pulmonary Function Tests: Measure lung capacity and airflow.

Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap): Collect cerebrospinal fluid for neurological diseases.
